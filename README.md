# Syllabus for CS 6431 

Welcome to CS  6431, security and privacy technologies. This is a PhD-level
course focused on academic research in computer security. We will take a 
tour of a variety of contemporary research topics, with an eye towards not only
learning something about the individual topics, but also dissecting what makes
for successful research in computer security. Computer security is quite
broad,  which is one of its appeals -- security issues arise in any area, and
security is hard. 
 

Instructor: Tom Ristenpart (he/him) (https://rist.tech.cornell.edu)

Office hours: By appointment

Lectures: M/W 10:10am - 11:25am 

NYC Location: Bloomberg 165

Ithaca Location: Gates G11


### Course logistics and classrooms 

PhD classes taught by Cornell Tech instructors, including this one, are
broadcast to both Cornell campuses, in NYC and Ithaca.  

A zoom link will be shared via Canvas. I might occasionally deliver lectures
remotely (due to travel) using the same zoom link, and will announce that via
the schedule (see below). The default will be in-person instruction from NYC.
Please attend class in-person (in NYC or Ithaca) when I'm teaching in-person;
please let me know if you need to attend via zoom. If so, the default should be
camera on, but feel free to let me know you if you are more comfortable having
your camera off for a personal reason. 



### Pre-requisites

This class is for CS PhD students, though PhD students from other
departments with suitable background may get a lot out of it as well. Please
contact me if you have concerns about your background. 

Space allowing, I will make exceptions for undergrads or masters students who
have significant research or other relevant experience.  

If interested, please come to the first day of class or contact me soon after; 
this will give me a sense of demand and how we are doing on physical space. 


### Requirements

The class will focus on topics in computer security. You will need to read
papers prior to class, and be engaged in discussions. I hope to set aside time
during class for small group discussions on papers, though we may have to
experiment a bit with the AV setup.  

* Class participation:  20% 
* Project proposal and project reviews: 20%
* Project proposal: 20%
* Project: 40%

The project will be the biggest piece of this class; the class is, after all, an
introduction to research in computer security. Projects can be in small groups
or individually. I will update the schedule with
information on due dates. 


### Project

Will be posted  shortly.
